        <p>I am currently studying at San Jose State University for my Digital Media Art BFA. I have transferred here from West Valley Community College where I graduated with my AA in Liberal Arts. During my days at West Valley I learned the basics
          for programs such as Atom, Illustrator, Photoshop, Premiere, and Animate, Processing, and Maya. I also did hands on creation during 2d and 3d design, ceramics, and drawing classes. Once I got to San Jose State University I had accumulated
          quite a bit of
          finished
          digital pieces that have made it into my portfolio.</p>
        <p>My professional experiences have consisted of aiding companies with advertisement creation for their brand. I have experienced a company setting and the work put into advertising at Hortonworks, a company which specializes in managing
          and
          processing data. I have also worked for a private owned business called Rock it Wear, a business that sells clothing that empowers women. For both companies, I created ads and edited photographs. Most of the work done for them was through
          Photoshop and illustrator. I communicated the client’s visons and needs through email or in person meetings. I would send several different versions of the clients’ visons for them to approve or disapprove before we agreed on a finished
          product that they felt captured the essence of what their company stood for and the message that they wanted to get across.</p>
        <p>I have many strengths that have helped me acquire those experiences as well as keep me successful with my own work. I always stay organized while I am creating digital work as well as in everyday life which keeps me punctual and
          reliable.
          My attention to detail and patience for tedious work would benefit your editorial team. I am a team player and work well in group settings for I find it very useful and productive to have active voices and different opinions
          brainstorming
          the task at hand. Group settings also provide me with constructive criticism and feedback on my work that I invite from my colleges and well as my clients.</p>
