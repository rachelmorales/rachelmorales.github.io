        <p>I am currently studying at San Jose State University for my Digital Media Art BFA. I have transferred here from West Valley Community College where I graduated with my AA in Liberal Arts. During my days at West Valley I learned the basics
          for programs such as Atom, Illustrator, Photoshop, Premiere, and Animate, Processing, and Maya. I also did hands on creation during 2d and 3d design, ceramics, and drawing classes. Once I got to San Jose State University I had accumulated
          quite a bit of
          finished
          digital pieces that have made it into my portfolio.</p>
        <p>My professional experiences have consisted of aiding companies with advertisement creation for their brand. I have experienced a company setting and the work put into advertising at Hortonworks, a company which specializes in managing
          and
          processing data. I have also worked for a private owned business called Rock it Wear, a business that sells clothing that empowers women. For both companies, I created ads and edited photographs. Most of the work done for them was through
          Photoshop and illustrator. I communicated the client’s visons and needs through email or in person meetings. I would send several different versions of the clients’ visons for them to approve or disapprove before we agreed on a finished
          product that they felt captured the essence of what their company stood for and the message that they wanted to get across.</p>
        <p>I have many strengths that have helped me acquire those experiences as well as keep me successful with my own work. I always stay organized while I am creating digital work as well as in everyday life which keeps me punctual and reliable.
          My attention to detail and patience for tedious work would benefit any team. I am a team player and work well in group settings for I find it very useful and productive to have active voices and different opinions brainstorming the task at
          hand. Group settings also provide me with constructive criticism and feedback on my work.</p>

      <div class="p2">
        <p>My work is mostly digital because I find a sense of freedom in creating with technology where the possibilities are endless. I usually incorporate images from the web into my creations or I scan hand drawn images that I have made
          and digitally recreate them. I keep a natural color aesthetic within all my pieces and add textures as to not make my work seem too flat. When starting to create new pieces I pull inspiration from my passions and feelings in life and
          create personable pieces. If given the opportunity, I make interactive pieces that get people to uncover a deeper meaning. </p>
        <p>I have many recurring themes that can be recognized in my finished works, one of them being feminism. I recently created a Neon Art series in which the main goal was to question and defy the history of neon art which was built around
          depicting women as sex objects. Often neon signs were found in strip clubs, dimly lit male dominated bars, and seedy motels with the goal being to dehumanize women. In the series, I create neon signs in different mediums that weaken
          the hyper-sexualization of the female form by embracing all types of our figures and speaking up about the issue. </p>
        <p>Another theme that I like to incorporate in my works are environmental issues. Even if my work doesn’t improve the state of the earth I always see it as an opportunity to raise awareness and inform. For example, in a recent animation
          short that I made, I set the scene of a peaceful grassy hilly meadow in which two bees are seen flying toward some flourishing pink flowers. While they are on their way over, the hills catch on fire and red light floods the landscape
          and before they can reach the flowers, they start to wilt and are unable to pollinate them. The video stood as a reminder of the poor state that our earth is still in and how it is increasingly getting worse. I chose the bees since
          they were at one point a universal symbol of how bad global warming was and how the poor conditions caused them to disappear at rapid rates. </p>
